<h1> TOURS AND TRAVELS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM </h1>









THE PROBLEM.
<p> The Tours and Travels Management System aims to address the challenges faced by travel agencies, tour operators
and corporate travel departments in efficiently managing and organizing tours and travel-related activities. 
The traditional manual processes involved in handling bookings, managing customer data and ensuring compliance 
with travel policies are time-consuming, error-prone and lack scalability. The system seeks to streamline these 
processes by providing a centralized platform that automates various tasks such as online bookings, customer 
relationship management and reporting. By addressing these challenges the system enables businesses to enhance 
their operational efficiency, deliver personalized services, optimize resource utilization, improve customer satisfaction
and ultimately achieve better business outcomes in the competitive travel industry. </p>
